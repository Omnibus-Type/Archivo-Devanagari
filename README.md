Archivo Narrow was designed to be used simultaneously in print and digital platforms. The technical and aesthetic characteristics of the font are both crafted for high performance typography.

Archivo is a *grotesque sans serif* typeface family from [Omnibus Type](http://omnibus-type.com/). It was originally designed for highlights and headlines. This family is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. It includes Narrow and Black styles, and was derived from Chivo.
